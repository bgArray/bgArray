I'm a fan of coding and developing, and I may like anything that needs thinking. 
Now I am developing some python projects that's about music, OCR, AI. 
Also, I like playing Minecraft, you can find many programs about Minecraft in my or Trim Organization's repositories.
In addition, I take part in FRC this year and hope to meet some excellent players!
